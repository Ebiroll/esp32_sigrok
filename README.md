# Sigrok esp 32 

A SUMP compatible logic analyser for the esp32, for use with i.e sigrok
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrok

For digital input, an Open bench logic sniffer is emulated. (ols)
A Rigol DS scope (rigol-ds) is emulated in order to allow sampling of analouge input.
Use pulseview to get the graphical input.

# Quickstart
The different options as described below are defined in the file app-config.h
The default configuration is to use SUMP over UART
Go to the configuration options and set ssid and password
    make menuconfig 
    Wifi and TFT Configuration  --->

Also set
```
  Bootloader log verbosity (No output)  --->    
  Compiler options ->  Optimization Level (Release (-Os)) 
```
When using the WROVER board do,
sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB1 -l 5 --scan
Otherwise 
sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB0 -l 5 --scan

Connect PIN 18-(2400 Baud UART output) to pin 12,13 or 14
Then start pulseview 
Select input device (ols) over serial
You might have to press scan a few times until the ESP32 appears.
Set samplingrate to 10 KHZ 

![sump_uart](sump_uart.png)

# added experimental tft drawing
Just set correct display in config.
The green line has a quarter of the sampling speed comapre to the white line
```
Make sure we got
#define CONFIG_EXAMPLE_USE_TFT 1
You can also define 
#define USE_SEMA 1
Then sampling will be done in a separate thread.
This gives much wose results!
It is also possible to change the constant in analog,c
Lower value -> Higher sampling rate.
// A complete sample loop takes about 8000 cycles, will not go faster
#define COUNT_FOR_SAMPLE 17000
```
However, It does not work with all 3 variants enabled at the same time.


# Analogue
```
(ADC1_CHANNEL_0)      //GPIO 36
```

![uart](analog.png)

Still lots of tuning to do here.

# Pins
Pins that can be used for logical input on the WROVER board.

```
            12,
            13,
            14,
            15,
```

Pins defined  for logical input with the code in this repository over SUMP.

```
            12,
            13,
            14,
            15,
```

Testdata in this example. To get testdata connect i.e pin 17 & 22 and pin 23 & 18
```
            17, remote device, square pulse
            18, 2400 Baud UART with repeated text, "sump"
```



If using the WROVER-kit, you can use the JTAG chip to do data aquisition.
To get better debuginfo, start pulseview with logging,  -l 5 
On the WROVER dev kit, it seems that the FTDI-LA drivers are used.

https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=libsigrok.git;a=tree;f=src/hardware/ftdi-la
This allows sampling without a second ESP32 up to 10Mhz.

In the code the sump protocol is implemented over serial and tcp/ip. 

I found that the terminal program cutecom allowed sending single HEX bytes, this is useful for debugging the implementation of the SUMP protocol.

# Pin mapping

In sigrok the following WROVER-KIT pins are mapped like this.
```
PIN13 = ADBUS0
PIN12 = ADBUS1
PIN15 = ADBUS2
PIN14 = ADBUS3
```

THE Jtag interface uses the following pins.
```
1 	CHIP_PU 	TRST_N
2 	MTDO / GPIO15 	TDO
3 	MTDI / GPIO12 	TDI
4 	MTCK / GPIO13 	TCK
5 	MTMS / GPIO14 	TMS
```

# Wrover debug pins
The following red/green/blue led is available on the WROVER kit.
```
  RED    gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_0, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
  GREEN  gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_2, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
  BLUE   gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_4, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
	gpio_set_level(GPIO_NUM_0, 0);
```

After making sure you use the correct Component config â†’ 
ESP32-specific -> Main XTAL frequency
Another good idea, might be to set these values.
```
  Bootloader log verbosity (No output)  --->    
  Compiler options ->  Optimization Level (Release (-Os)) 
```
Otherwise they will interfer with the SUMP protocol.

To get some test data, connect  a 30/15 ms pulse is generated with the remote device on pin 17
```
app_main() {
    ...
    send_remote_pulses();
    rmt_write_items(config.channel, items, 1, 0);
}
```
When starting the sigrok gui, pulseview, the device was identified and this is how the timing analysis looks like.

# Analysis of UART 2400 Baud
To get some more testdata the uart sends the text "sump" on pin 18
```
static void uartWRITETask(void *inpar) {
  uart_port_t uart_num = UART_NUM_1;    
  echoLine[0]='s';
  echoLine[1]='u';
  echoLine[2]='m';
  echoLine[3]='p';

  while(true) {
    int size = uart_write_bytes(uart_num, (const char *)echoLine, 4);
    vTaskDelay(10 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
  }
}
```

# Project status
Now it is working with sigrok and the latest version of esp-idf.

Perhaps this bugfix was helpful, but initially the SUMP protocol was not working
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/f482e9e54ce83e249e46f5ee082f6ffb61431339


If you test repeatedly with 
```
sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB1 -l 5 --scan
sigrok-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/192.168.1.130/5555  -l 5 --scan
```
With my version of sigrok and esp-idf rigol-ds will  work 9/10 times. 

To get more stable performance try removing the driver you dont plan to use in app_main()

For analog data with rigol driver
```
    //init_uart();

    scpi_server_init(&xHandlingTask);
    //sump_init();
    //sump_server_init();
    //sump_uart();
```

For digital data with ols (sump) driver
```
    init_uart();

    //scpi_server_init(&xHandlingTask);
    sump_init();
    //sump_server_init();
    sump_uart();
```
  sump_server_init(); is used for SUMP data on port 5566 and debugging
  Normal rigol-data is handled on port 5555 


Further development of ESP32 as a scope will be carried out here,
https://github.com/Ebiroll/qemu_esp32/tree/master/examples/38_wifiscope


# Sigrok
In pulseview
```
Chose driver, Open bench Logic sniffer (ols)
Choose the interface, i.e./dev/ttyUSB0
Press Scan for devices,
If successful select ESP32 with 8 channels.
Change samplerate 10kHz. Its currently hardcoded to sample at this rate.
```
   I did some experimental aquisition with parallell i2s aquisition in espScope.c
	 The idea was to to route out the audio PLL signal and use as PCLK input
   Also the HSYNC and VSYNC siglnals must be HIGH for DMA sampling to work
   However, I never got this to work. Probably some other clock signal is missing.


Also you can add more input pins by adding them in,
uint16_t getSample() &  portc_init(void)

For analog data try the rigol-ds over wifi on port 5555.

# Command line run
When developing, this is useful and repeatable

```
sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB0 -l 5  -c samplerate=10Khz --samples 100
sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB0 -l 5 --scan
sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB1 -l 5 --show
```

SCPI over the network also works now.

    sigrok-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/127.0.0.1/5555  -l 5 --scan

It is possible tp run sump over network or USB, however ols driver only supports SUMP over serial.
To use SUMP over network you must find some other program.
I tried the PIPISTRELLO p-ols driver. This is however his did not work.


To debug this use printf for debugging
```
void sump_debug(char *str,unsigned int value) {
    printf("%s 0x%X\n",str,value);   
}
```
Remove call to init_uart
//init_uart();
screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200
sigrok-cli -d p-ols:conn=tcp-raw/192.168.1.130/5566  -l 5 --scan



To debug SUMP over serial, then use  TCP/IP for debugging.
```
To use debug output, remove #if 0 in:
sump_debug()

```

nc 192.168.1.130 5566
This port is also used for the SUMP protocol over TCP/IP
If you use the Pipistrello OLS (p-ols) then you can use this
sigrok-cli -d p-ols:conn=tcp-raw/192.168.1.130/5566  -l 5 --scan
I never got SUMP over TCP/IP to work.


For data aquisition High resolution timer is used.

Trying to  add rigol emulation and emulate sending of analouge and digital waveforms

In directory linux, you can build a test client, it also listens to port 5555
./test

To try connect 
 sigrok-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/127.0.0.1/5555  -l 5 --scan
This will send *IDN? to the instrument

You can also try this 
./sigrock-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/192.168.1.130/5555  -l 5  --show
